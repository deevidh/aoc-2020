# AoC - Day 6

I'm sure I could have tackled this whole challenge using sets (the challenge answers are given by the union and intersection of the sets respectively).  However on a weekend morning, my brain was just seeking out the quickest win and I doubt I'll take the time to rewrite the solution.

My approach was straightforward and fairly simple to implement.

**TIL:**

- Part 2 led me to using `Counter` from the [collections module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html). In my approach it was the perfect tool to count the frequency of elements in an iterable.
